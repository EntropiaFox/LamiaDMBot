v0.2.0
- Loading Telegram bot token from a separate file (With 'lamia.cfg' as its name) instead of a hardcoded value.
- New table "users" in the database, needed for future user-specific rolls and characters. Add it manually if you don't wish to lose any stored rolls, or simply delete it and let LamiaDMBot rebuild the database.
- Optional "secret" value which is used when talking to the bot for the first time. In a future update, once set, any new user must know it before the bot may reply to their messages.

v0.1.0
- Initial commit
